# Roughly - iOS

Roughly was built to aid with the estimating process to ensure estimates are being generated faster and more accurately before being sent out to clients.

## Inspiration
Inspiration for this project came from my struggle to account for
meetings, phone calls, and general overhead when estimating Web and iOS projects.

## Goals
Goals for this project were to form an opinion of ReSwift (a unidirectional flow
library for Swift inspired by Redux) and to have a simple project to experiment with
new concepts, patterns or ideas I come across.
